    "INTRO": "CUCUit is a digital space that comes from a place of love, from a group of friends dotting the countries that were mostly hit by Covid-19 in Europe, Italy and Spain. It aims at offering a new instrument to nurture human interactions so to find relief and support during this weird time. Our vision is to provide a meeting point, a community where it is possible to share interests and ideas, to prompt stimulating conversations and fun gatherings, to speak face to face with like minded individuals, being it old friends or new pals, about any topic of interest. Think out of the walls! CUCUit will allow you to keep yourself active, challenged and stimulated, trying new yummy recipes, moving your body on african rhythms, being part of brainstorming sessions and so much more. <br /> Last but not least, we want to give our contribution and facilitate financial aid to hospitals and health organisations, standing next to all those who are fighting against Covid-19.
